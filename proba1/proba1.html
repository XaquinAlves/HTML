        <h2><img src="images/LEC.png" width="225" height="225" alt="lecLogo" align="left"> The Blue Wall </h2>
        
        <p>reigns supreme and now sits at 5-1 in the League of Legends EMEA Championship (LEC) after Karmine 
            Corp achieved its first-ever 3-0 week in the league. Tied for first place, the organization continues its ascent as 
            it prepares to face Vitality, Fnatic, and BDS next week. In an exclusive interview, Vladimiros "Vladi" Kourtidis, 
            the team's midlaner, discusses his recent improvements, pinpoints KC's goals, and shares his thoughts on the level of 
            the league.You dominated Team Heretics today and secured a playoff spot. How does it feel to take such
            a convincing win?</p>
            
         <p>Vladimiros "Vladi" Kourtidis: "Obviously locking in playoffs feels good, but this team is capable of winning it all, 
            as I’ve said before. So, it’s not like we’re satisfied—it's just a good first step. I wouldn’t say this game was a stomp.
            I think it should have been a 20–25-minute game, but some unfortunate fights happened. It ended up going to 35 minutes
            with me being 10-0, which is illegal. But yeah, overall, it was a good game. We had a little more fun than 
            usual on stage.</p>
